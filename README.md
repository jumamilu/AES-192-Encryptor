# AES-192 Secure File Encryption Tool
This repository contains the full code for the Bachelor of Science dissertation project " Implementing a User-friendly Tool to Encrypt Personal Files Using Advanced Encryption Standard" by Juma Milu, Mzuzu University, 2025.
# Overview 
A cross-platform (Windows/Linux), user-friendly desktop application for encrypting and decrypting personal files using AES-192 algorithm in GCM mode. Encryption keys are derived from passwords using the Argon2i algorithm.
## Features
- Secure Encryption: Uses AES-192 in Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) for confidentiality and integrity.
- Modern Key Derivation: Uses Argon2i, a memory-hard function, to generate strong keys from passwords.
- Cross-platform: Runs on both Windows and Linux operating systems.
- Local & offline: All encryption/decryption happens locally on your machine; no data is set online.
